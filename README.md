Offline ready web app that allows encrypted communication across less trustworthy channels.

Implements private public key encryption.


Encrypt this:

```
Hi there
```

To this simple format, which you can even print

```
sD 2dF0 aYTXzI ZvW09m mVperMhx nyq P9W. hao4 G+cv5Q5 +0ZPoR t3JNK9 UoOeoEnRB 
```

And decrypt it back to the original

```
Hi there
```


Ready to self host, just go [gh-pages branch](https://github.com/enigma-reloaded/enigma-reloaded/tree/gh-pages) and deploy it.
