Offline ready web app, that allows encrypted communication across less trustworthy channels.

Implements private public key encryption.


## Usage

1. Get your public key to your buddy, securely or not, doesn't matter

```

dHM gZm9yIHVz a W5nIGVu aWdt YQ.e0e a57cdd 4c0f509 193d6ad180 eab227
```

2. Add your buddy public key to your contacts list

```

```

3. Then you can talk, encrypt this:

```
Hi there, my name is Enigma, and I'm your simple tool to ensure your messages are 100% safe ðŸ˜‰
```

4. To this simple format, which can be sent over any text based message platform to your buddy

```

hUqSdA DJXcIm xJ46xctBV 7lAtXbrgE NdCIQ? TN2a/iNr5N Pl8SP/iA0Z 0w2ilPdE S6fy
```

5. So he can decrypt it back to the original

```
Hi there, my name is Enigma, and I'm your simple tool to ensure your messages are 100% safe ðŸ˜‰
```

and this works the same with any file you want to transfer securely.
